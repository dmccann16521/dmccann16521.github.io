  <p>My  graphic design experience started for me back in 1999 - 2000 when I was able to  complete my internship at Colorbok in the prototype department for a  scrapbook, stationery and kids craft company. Shortly after receiving a associate degree in applied  science – Graphic design from Jackson Community College I was offered a full  time position in the prototype department. Between  2000 to Jan 2nd of 2012 I was a prototype artist and a production  artist.  I was proficient on Adobe programs of illustrator and photoshop with version of  CS5. I created a variety of prototypes/moc-ups of new product to be presented  to new or existing customers. I was one of the operators of a laser cutter and  large format printer. I set up files with CMYK colors and details instructions  and sent to the manufactures in China that produced the product designed and  sold by Colorbok. I design and few Colorbok and artist scrapbooking product  lines and worked on helping with new product ideals.<br>
</p>
  <p>Since May of 2009, I have been  a contracted sports and community event photographer for the Sun Times News  newspaper, covering the high school sports and community events for the Saline,  Dexter and Chelsea areas.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Between  2007 to 2018 I was a photographer and graphic designer with a local theater  group. I was assigned as the photographer taking cast photos, rehearsal photos  used in pre-performance advertising and performance photos, create photo  collages that was giving out as cast gifts. I had created almost all the art  and designs for posters, fliers, program covers and T-shirt designs promotion  the active productions.</p>

  <p>Along with my husband we are currently working on rebranding our photography  business under Double D Image Creations. </p>
